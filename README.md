# The Game
How good are you at geography? Are you a non-American? Prove it by winning this game!
<br>
Guess the Brazilian State is a game where you have to point, on the map of Brazil, where a certain state indicated by the game is located.<br>
Play in two game modes, point click on the map, or writing which states you remember.
<br><br>

#### Note: the language of this program is Portuguese (pt-BR)


### Version 1.1
```
ðŸ’¡ NEW! - Sounds / UX Improvements.

## Point n' click

A random order from the list of all Brazilian states is generated, 
so following this order, the program will indicate you to click on 
that state on the map, if you make a mistake, you will lose your turn 
with that state, so the game will continue to the next one, until you 
finish all the 26 states and the Federal District.

## Typing mode

This is a free game mode, you can try to remember as many states as you can, you don't need to know their locations on the maps, just the names. <br>
The game will run until you complete all states, or when you type "parar", then your score will shows on the screen, as well the names of all states that you couldn't remember.

#### My ideas for the next versions:
- [x] Sound effects.
- [ ] The possibility of asking the game for hints, when you are struggle, in both modes.
